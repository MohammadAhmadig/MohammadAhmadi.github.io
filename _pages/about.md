- As a Data Scientist, I work with data and develop intelligent algorithms capable of learning and analysing data to predict events and trends. I have in-depth knowledge of data science, programming languages, mathematics and the development of machine learning algorithms. During my time at university, I studied machine learning and computer vision, so I am doing this job today. All the various courses I have been studying during my undergrad and graduate were useful to build solid foundations.
