- I analyze data and develop intelligent algorithms and models capable of learning and interpreting data to predict events and trends. I have in-depth knowledge of data science, programming languages, mathematics and the development of machine learning algorithms. During my time at university, I studied artificial intelligence and machine learning, so I am doing this job today. All the various courses I have been studying during my undergrad and graduate were useful to build solid foundations.
