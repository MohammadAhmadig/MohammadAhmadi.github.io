Pattern recognition and data mining in high-dimensional data are complex due to their large volume, low processing speed, and low accuracy. Therefore, dimensional reduction methods have received particular attention.
This book focuses more on feature selection in supervised learning systems and the final chapters on feature extraction and unsupervised learning.
